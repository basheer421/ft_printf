init with va_start()
each call for va_arg() goes to next occurance
finish up with va_end()

so if the main (first) argument is "hello" and (...) arguments are 'h' 'x'
	we can accsess them by va_arg()
	the first call of va_arg() will return 'h'
	the second one will return 'x' and so on... 

use strstr() to find %s and all %x flags
